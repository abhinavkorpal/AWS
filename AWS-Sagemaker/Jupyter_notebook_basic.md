## Jupyter notebook basics
    
For those of you that are fairly new to using Jupyter notebooks, here are a couple of items to get you started:

* This notebook has two types of cells: Code and Markdown.  This is a Markdown (documentation) cell.  As you proceed through the notebook, you'll read the documentation in these cells to understand the steps being taken.
* Code cells are formatted differently and have tracking information to the left of the cell: `In [ ]`.  If there is a blank between the brackets, the cell has not yet been executed.  If there is a number between the brackets, that number indicates the sequence in which the cell was executed (1 for the first, 2 for the next, and so on).  If there is an asterisk in the brackets (i.e., `In [*]`, the cell is currently executing, or is waiting for some cell before it to complete before it will begin executing.
* To execute a code cell, simply click on the `Cell` menu and click `Run Cells and Select Below`.  Or, much more conveniently, simply press Shift-Enter (i.e., the Shift key and the Enter key at the same time).
* You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard (not the up and down arrow icons below the menu bar) to move back and forth between cells.\n",

Online help is provided from the `Help` menu.  You can also find tutorials for Jupyter with a simple web search.
